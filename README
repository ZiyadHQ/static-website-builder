a tool to build a simple html website to display text and image(.png and .jpg) content of a directory in a structured manner.

future work:

-instead of using 'file://' use http to serve files
-add an http server than can be open to the internet to serve the contents of the generated .html pages
-all generated .html files to be stored in a special 'generated' directory
